# EnsNet: Convolutional Neural Network with Fully Connected Subnetworks

My code is made from the research paper [ENSEMBLE LEARNING IN CNN AUGMENTED WITH FULLY
CONNECTED SUBNETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08562v3.pdf) published on the 25th of March, 2020.

EnsNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture augmented with fully connected subnetworks. The architecture divides the feature maps generated by the last convolutional layer into disjoint subsets and assigns them to separate fully connected subnetworks.
